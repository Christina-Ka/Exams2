I suppose we know electronic processing. Simply a kind of repetition of the recording back into the room, such that, those frequencies, amplifying one another, build on top. This relationship between sound and space was investigated in a number of lousiest pieces. One of them is a piece, really a kind of wonderful performance piece. There is a recording of this. It’s not very exciting recording, but imagine it will be really fun to perform this piece, which is piece called “Vespers”, » dedicated to baths. These, performers, blindfolded performers moved around the space with eco-location devices and basically tried just to navigate the space and one another. This survey expresses lousiest interesting, his interesting in relationship between sound and architecture. 
He said “I began thinking of sounds in terms of short and long wavelengths, not a high and low pitches or notes written in time from left to right on a page. Thinking of sounds as measurable wavelengths [...] has changed my whole idea of music from a metaphor to a fact and, in a real way, has connected me with architecture.” Now the same can be said of the work of Maryanne Amacher, whose work was less concerned with architectural volumes, then with the very infrastructure buildings and spaces. In 1980, she launched a project called “Music for sound join rooms”, in which called for the installation for loud speakers and transducers, throughout the building to generate what she called “structure born” sound. Not only air born sound, but sound carried by the very infrastructures of buildings by the wood, metal, stone and plaster, material surfaces of a house, of a gallery, a museum. So, after receiving a commission, she’d go to a particular space and she would investigate for weeks and sort of determine the various ways in which ... in which she wanted to self locate the situated sound. She liked in this process to a kind of choreography to theatre, to cinema... She aims to a kind create spaces of choro and tactile intrigue. Carefully placing and sequencing vibrations to suggest distance or to suggest a kind of choro-close ups. These are often very kind of intense pieces and I’ll play you a little bit in a second again. She recorded very little on CDs, thinking that the CD is…any kind of recording was not true to the experience, which was to be in the space and to hear sound, not just came through out to loud speakers, but hear it and feel it very physically in the structure of the space. I’m going to play you an exit, just about a minute exit from a piece that she did in the Tokushima, Japan, in this cultural center, where she used a bunch of different spaces in the building to create this kind of “structure born” sound. And this is just what she thought of kind of pale comparison, but none or less. Here’s the recorded the two channel version.
Super and tense pieces often and, you know, loud volumes and, you know, being a sort of physically in the space have a kind of rewarming effect.
None of these pioneers, none of these folks have ever been talking about themselves as sound artists to describe their work as sound artists. That term only really emerged and came to widespread usage in the mid 1990s, the way it been around before in the US, in the UK and in Germany, where was called “Klangkunst”and developed very strong institutional support that still exist today. All these artists though, as I mentioned earlier, all these artists tried to find new terms to describe the work that they were doing and really tried to stretch the limits of music and to connect the sonic that they were doing with the plastic arts and architecture. The term “sound art”» emerged as kind of a part of broader cultural shift that other people think as the “sonic turn.” That is somewhere around the late 1990s-early 2000s. There was a kind of broad turn in the academy and also in the visual and sonic arts. Just an image of a bunch of books that came right around the kind of the turn of the millennium, by anthropologists, by sociologists, by historians, who tried to find the history of sound, tried to situate sound as a kind of marker , cultural and temporal difference. Right around the same time, sound art as it edited, it came to be something that was embraced by curators, maybe a little bit less so by artists and presented in a bunch of survey exhibitions again. Just a quick list of some important survey exhibitions some around to the turn of the millennium in Berlin, in London, in New York, in Tokyo, in Paris. It’s in this context that term “sound art” came to be...came to really... coming to the art world currency, those that I mentioned on the outset. There was still a lot of resistance to it. A lot of things can ever count for this sonic turn. It partly seems to go inside with the rise of the internet, which connected experimental communities all over the world and fostered some of kind of awareness of the history that I’ve been presenting. I think the widespread availability of digital tools enabled translations across media, allowed ordinary people to do things that otherwise required big institutional support. I think partly also that demise of the record industry right around 1999-2000 with the rise of apps and other things, made musicians and artists look for other venues and ways to present their work, but I also think that this kind of sonic turn was fostered by the waning of the long time in cultural theory and criticism and I think in our history as well, that favorite text and image, and in general focused on an ocean of representation that both sound and music and sound more broadly really did have much of, kind of residence with.
